# SheGoesTech_22_Final_Project

Project by: Ugne Vaisvilaite and Ieva Zarina

## Introduction

This is the final She Goes Tech training course project. The project consists of web scraping and data analysis parts. Data was scrapped from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com travel accommodation sites.

The main target was to analyze which site offers the cheapest one-night stays and price and rating ratio.
